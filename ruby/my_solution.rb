# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
## require_relative allows you to insert a file that is relative to the file.

require_relative 'state_data'

#=======================================================================
# Reflection Section
# The STATE_DATA syntax makes the data unchangeable because it's a constant
# Require relative makes data from the same folder accessible, require full path is needed
# You can iterate through a hash using .each or .map
# The parameter values were not being used so were uneccessary
# .floor was included in each if else statement when it could be assigned at the end when the value was printed
# Refactoring!
